INTRODUCTION

  CC is a c compiler. It converts C code into i386 assembly with GAS syntax.

WHAT IT SUPPORTS

  functions and recursion
  if and while (requires brackets)
  variables (only 4 bytes)
  pointers
  arithmetic and assignment
  operator precedence and parentheses

WHAT IT DOES NOT SUPPORT

  structs (but it can use pointers to objects)
  static typing (everything is an int, even pointers)
  compiler flags (includes, defines, etc)
  comparison
  floating point registers
  for
  else
  comments
  compound declaration

COPYING

COMPILE

  make all

USAGE

  CC accepts input from stdin and outputs to stdout.

    ./cc < input.c > output.s

  To finish compilation, it will need to be assembled

    as --gstabs -32 output.s -o out.o

  and linked

    ld -o a.out -dynamic-linker /path/to/ld-linux.so.# /path/to/crt1.o \
	  /path/to/crti.o -lc out.o /path/to/crtn.o

  ld-linux.so.# is usually found in /lib/; crt1.o, crti.o, and crtn.o are
  usually found in /usr/lib/i386-linux-gnu/. To compile the example program,
  you may need to modify example/Makefile to fit your computer's structure.
